<h1>Code Documentation: Trash Detection Simulation</h1>
General Description
This script is responsible for initiating the webcam, simulating the detection of trash, and updating the user interface with the number of detected trash items and the total amount detected in tons.

<h2>Variables</h2> <b>totalTrashDetected:</b> A variable that keeps track of the total amount of trash detected over time, initialized to zero. <h2>Event Listeners</h2> <b>document.getElementById('startDetection').addEventListener('click', function() {...});</b><br> This event listener is triggered when the "Iniciar Detecção" button is clicked. It initiates the webcam and starts the trash detection simulation. <h3>Webcam Initialization</h3> When the button is clicked, the script attempts to access the webcam using the <b>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia</b> method. If successful, the video stream is displayed in the <b>video</b> element with the ID <b>webcam</b>.<br> If there’s an error while accessing the webcam, it logs an error message to the console. <h3>Trash Detection Simulation</h3> <b>setInterval(() => {...}, 5000);</b><br> This function simulates the detection of trash every 5 seconds. Inside the interval function: - A random number of detected items is generated using <b>Math.floor(Math.random() * 5)</b>, simulating between 0 to 4 trash items detected. - The total detected trash count is updated by adding the newly detected items to <b>totalTrashDetected</b>. - The text content of the element with the ID <b>detected-trash</b> is updated to display the number of detected items. - The total trash detected is converted from grams to tons by dividing <b>totalTrashDetected</b> by 1000 and is displayed in the element with the ID <b>totalTrash</b>. <h1>Final Considerations</h1> This script serves as a basic implementation for trash detection simulation in a web application. The webcam integration allows for real-time interaction, while the random detection simulation provides a foundation for integrating actual AI-powered trash detection in the future.
